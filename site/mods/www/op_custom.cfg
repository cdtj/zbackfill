#   Operation Table
#   The entry defined in this table contains the following information:    
#   The operation name	    - The name of the operation specified in the 
#			      request received by the webengine. 
#   The function name	    - The name of the spell function for processing the 
#			      request. 
#   The above two values are required and they can be followed by the following 
#   keywords: 
#   NONE, VIEW, or MODIFY   - The security value required by the operation. If 
#			      not specified, the default value is NONE. 
#                 NOTE: The FACTORY argument is required with any operation
#                       having a security value other than NONE.
#   READ, SEARCH, or UPDATE - The type of the request for categorizing the 
#			      performance monitor data. If not specified, the 
#			      default value is READ. 
#   NOLOGIN		    - The flag for bypassing the login. If not 
#			      specified, the login is on.
#   SINGLE_FRAME  The form displayed by the operation should be its own
#                 page and not part of the standard USD frameset
#   New operation can be added to this file or to a new file, but it's 
#   recommended that the new operation should be added to a new file. The new 
#   file has to have the prefix,  "op_", and the extension, ".cfg", and the new 
#   file can be placed under either the directory,  NX_ROOT/bopcfg/www or the 
#   directory, NX_ROOT/site/mods/www. 
#   If there are entries with the same operation name, the webengine uses the 
#   entry it reads last and the file reading order for the webengine is: 
#   op_table.cfg under NX_ROOT/bopcfg/www 
#   op_*.cfg under NX_ROOT/bopcfg/www
#   op_*.cfg under NX_ROOT/site/mods/www
